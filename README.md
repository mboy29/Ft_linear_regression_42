    Introductory project to AI and Machine Learning. 
    This project aims at creating a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

Usage :
1. Compile setup.sh to download all the necessary packages to execute the program
2. To train the module do : python3 -B train.py. By default the training program will read the data from ./DataSets/data.csv but you can pass as argument a path to another csv. Use the flag -bonus to execute the progam with bonuses.
3. To predict the price of a car do : python3 -B predict.py. Again, by default the predicting program will get the training values from ./DataSets/thetas.csv but you can pass as argument a path to another csv. Use the flag -bonus to execute the progam with bonuses.
